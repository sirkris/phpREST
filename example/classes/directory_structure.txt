The directory structure within classes/ is entirely up to you.  It has no effect on how each classes is handled by phpREST.  
So long as the paths in the dispatch table are accurate, it doesn't matter how you choose to organize the files in here.  You 
could mix them around in a maze of subdirectories or you could just dump them all into the classes/ subdirectory together.

That said, it is recommended that you create a logical directory structure that will make it easy to organize your class files.  
It's all for the sake of human usability.  In this example, each theoretical "/<class name>" exists as its own subdirectory, 
subordinate to the subdirectory of the class from which it is extending if there are multiple levels involved.  You should just 
do it in whatever way makes sense to you.

Note that the filenames themselves MUST be in the form of "<class name>.class.php", where "<class name>" is the name of the class 
contained in the file.  Anything else will either generate an error or cause the file to be ignored.
