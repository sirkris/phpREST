The files contained in this directory are derived from phpSQL, a component of the phpNova framework which is currently in early alpha stage of development.

These files are standalone and not tracked from the phpSQL repo.  They have also been preconfigured to use the phpREST_Example database.  You should not need 
to modify them at all if you imported the phpREST_Example.sql file directly and have the php_mysqli extension installed.

Note that these scripts are included solely for the benefit of the example API.  phpREST itself does not require any database connection in order to function.  
The API classes you write probably will, though, but you're free to use whatever SQL/etc code you wish.
